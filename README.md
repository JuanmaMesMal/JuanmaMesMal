## Hi there 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently studying Web Application Development at IES Zaidín Vergeles.
- 🌱 Learning JavaScript and going deeper into HTML & CSS (my daily battle 💻).
- 👯 Always up for collaborating on fun or weird web projects.
- 🤔 Still trying to figure out why my code only works when I don’t need it.
- 💬 Ask me about my coding disasters or favorite languages.
- 📫 You can find me as @iWhiiteX (I reply… eventually 😅).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Yes, I actually paid for WinRAR.
